hybrid_simulation package
====== 
 This code presents an open source tool for simulating autonomous vehicles in complex, high traffic, scenarios. 
 
 The hybrid simulation fully integrates and synchronizes SUMO a microscopic, multi-modal traffic simulator and GAZEBO a complex 3D simulator.

## Video

Experiments for the hybrid simulation tool in a merge scenario with very high traffic.
